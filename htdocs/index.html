Hello. This is test. <br><br><br>



<h3>Delivery of pbf tiles as static hosting</h3>
You have "htdocs" folder for static hosting.<br>
If your vector tiles (pbf) are stored in "htdocs" directory, your VT can be accessible at:<br>
<br>
http://localhost:8836/(directory name in "htdocs")/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf
<br>
<br>
We have sample tile from NaturalEarth. Try <a href="./pbf_tile/ne-test/1/1/1.pbf">pbf_tile/ne-test/1/1/1.pbf</a>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Maps</h3>
You can check the sample maps. Please make sure that you placed the location of the vector tile in their style files.<br>  
map1: <a href="./maps/map-mapbox.html">Sample map 1 based on mapbox GL JS (ver. 1.10)rom pbf</a><br>
map2: <a href="./maps/map-maplibre.html">Sample map 2 based on MapLibre GJ JS (ver. 2.0.1)</a><br>
